title: How do I post a job opportunity?
---

Firstly make sure that both:

* [I'm allowed to post a job](/faqs/canipostajob)
* [I'm in the right place to post my job](/faqs/wheredoipostmyjob)

To post a job opportunity in #jobpostings you need to use **@Slackboard**.
Either go to the home page of the app inside slack and click on the *Post a Job* button or go directly to the website:

[jobs.zatech.co.za](https://jobs.zatech.co.za)

@include('_partials/jobs-related')
