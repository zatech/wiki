title: How do I post a job opportunity?
---

Firstly make sure that both:

* [I'm allowed to post a job](/faqs/canipostajob)
* [I'm in the right place to post my job](/faqs/wheredoipostmyjob)

To post a job opportunity in [#jobpostings](https://zatech.slack.com/archives/C1RAZB24S) you need to use **[Sboj.dev](https://sboj.dev)**.

Make sure you sign up as an "Employer". Create a new "Seeking Role" entry, add all the relevant details, connect your Slack account and submit it for approval.

If you run into any trouble, please reach out either in the [#sboj](https://zatech.slack.com/archives/C04P9N0198T) channel or mail [hi@sboj.dev](hi@sboj.dev).
