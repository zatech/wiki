title: How do I invite someone?
---

Inviting someone to the group is easy, simply send them to [ZATech.co.za](https://zatech.co.za).

We don't accept invites requested through Slack directly to ensure that new users go through the process of reading and accepting the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zatech/code-of-conduct).
