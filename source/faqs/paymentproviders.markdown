title: Payment Providers in South Africa
---

Stripe has quickly become the default payment provider for startups around the world, but it's not available in South Africa. If you want to run a SaaS or accept online payments in South Africa, and don't have an international entity to bill through, you're probably looking for one of the following.

This page contains mainly a list of payment providers, but also information about sending money to/from South Africa, and related services (like Gumroad) that aren't strictly payment providers, but can be used nonetheless.
