## Overview

At ZATech we get quite a lot of jobpostings so having good communication is super important to ensure high signal and low noise.

We have a jobposting tool which will format a post nicely for you, see the "[How do I post a job opportunity?](/faqs/howtojobpost)" for more information.

## Guidelines:

All descriptions will likely be broken up into blocks of 2500 characters, we'd recommend you keep it to within that to ensure that prospective candiates read the whole description

A great description tries to do the following:

* Pitch the applicant on what work they'll do in the job
* Pitch what the company itself does
* Motivate why someone would pick your role over another

(Obviously it goes without saying that professional recruitment is not allowed, please see the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zatech/code-of-conduct) if you're unsure)
