Firstly make sure that both:
*  [I'm allowed to post a job]({% link faqs/canipostajob.markdown %})
*  [I'm in the right place to post my job]({% link faqs/wheredoipostmyjob.markdown %})

To post a job opportunity in #jobpostings you need to use **@Slackboard**.
Either go to the home page of the app inside slack and click on the *Post a Job* button or go directly to the website:

[jobs.zatech.co.za](https://jobs.zatech.co.za)
