To post a job opportunity in #jobpostings you need to use the "Post a Job" workflow. To do this click the ⚡️ icon next to the input bar and fill in the form.

Once the form has been submitted a request will be sent to the approval team.

Please note that according to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zatech/code-of-conduct) that professional recruiting is not allowed.

Some useful guidelines and expectations for job postings can be found on the [#jobpostings channel page]({% link jobpostings.markdown %}).
