Firstly make sure that both:
*  [I'm allowed to post a job]({% link faqs/canipostajob.markdown %})
*  [I'm in the right place to post my job]({% link faqs/wheredoipostmyjob.markdown %})

To post a job opportunity in #freelance-jobpostings you need to use the "Post a Freelance Job" workflow. To do this click the ⚡️ icon next to the input bar and fill in the form.
