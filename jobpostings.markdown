## Overview

At ZATech we get quite a lot of job postings so having good communication is super important to ensure high signal and low noise. We don't want to curtail the posts into a strict format, but we do want quality job postings please!

For convenience there is a Slack Workflow that will format a post nicely for you, see the "[How do I post a job opportunity?](/faqs/howtojobpost)" for more information.

## Guidelines:

If your post doesn't fit into 5 lines, you're probably overdoing it. If your post is 1 line, you're probably missing important data.

Basic info you really need to have:
* Position
* Company
* Location
* Contact Info

Suggested extra info
* Salary or at least a salary range
* Link to a web posting with more details

If you're really sold on writing an essay, please make a slack snippet.
That way it folds up and doesn't bloat the channel.

(Obviously it goes without saying that professional recruitment is not allowed, please see the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zatech/code-of-conduct) if you're unsure)
