A place for writers, especially those writing guides, tutorials and similar but everyone is very welcome!

We do talks and meetups occasionally to talk about writing and give feedback on each other's drafts.

See [https://github.com/sixhobbits/technical-writing](https://github.com/sixhobbits/technical-writing) for resources on how to get started with getting better at writing, or on how to get paid to write.
