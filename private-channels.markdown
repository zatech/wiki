## Overview

Over time a few private channels (either invite only, or invite on request) have sprung up. These are often formed around more controversial or divisive topics, and want to avoid the oversight that the moderation team carries out in public channels.

This page serves as a directory of such channels, with links to the threads in which one can request an invite.

Please note that with the channels being private, there is no direct admin or moderator oversight (by design) and there are often specific ground rules in each channel. This doesn't however mean that the Code of Conduct doesn't apply and general bad behaviour is still not allowed, such as racism, harassment, porn, piracy etc.
