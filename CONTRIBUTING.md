# Contributing

## Introduction

Thanks for taking an interest in contributing to the ZATech Wiki! For starters, make sure you're already familiar with the group's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zatech/code-of-conduct).

The rough goal of this wiki is to document some of the "institutional knowledge" of the various channels. Often questions are repeated frequently and the ephemeral nature of chat makes it hard to reference previous answer, this is a great plate to document such things.

## Jekyll

The site uses the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), please view their documentation for how to get started running the site locally.

## Guidelines

If you're unsure of anything or have questions, please feel free to ask them in the [#zmeta-wiki](https://app.slack.com/client/T03A23LJR/C01BXDMFG0P) channel.

To create a new page for a channel in the group; you can do so by making a new `.markdown` file in the root with the same name as the channel. It's also worth looking at [an example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zatech/zatech.github.io/main/algorithms.markdown) of the front matter for a channel page.
